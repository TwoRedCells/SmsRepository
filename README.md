SmsRepository
=============

This code accompanies the article [*Public SMS Message Repository* on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/996504/Public-SMS-Message-Repository).

This project enables an individual use a mobile phone to store a short message "in the cloud", 
that can be picked up by others using their mobile phone.

This project will demonstrate how to:
* use the Twilio TwiML API to respond to SMS messages;
* use XML as a data store;
* have some political fun along the way.

Compiled help in `.chm` format is located in the `docs` directory.
